Hygiene and Inconvenience in Toilet Seat Handling

This start-up project introduces a Pedal-Triggered Toilet Seat System designed to improve hygiene in public restrooms, especially in schools. The system allows users to lift and lower toilet seat covers hands-free using a simple foot pedal mechanism. By removing the need for hand or foot contact with the seat itself, it significantly reduces the spread of germs and promotes a cleaner, more sanitary restroom environment. This solution addresses the common issue of unhygienic practices in shared toilet facilities.
